# TASK Q1 -- Answer questions regarding your implementation
#
# Consider the following game between an adversary A and honest users H1 and H2: 
# 1) H1 picks 3 plaintext integers Pa, Pb, Pc arbitrarily, and encrypts them to the public
#    key of H2 using the scheme you defined in TASK 1.
# 2) H1 provides the ciphertexts Ca, Cb and Cc to H2 who flips a fair coin b.
#    In case b=0 then H2 homomorphically computes C as the encryption of Pa plus Pb.
#    In case b=1 then H2 homomorphically computes C as the encryption of Pb plus Pc.
# 3) H2 provides the adversary A, with Ca, Cb, Cc and C.
#
# What is the advantage of the adversary in guessing b given your implementation of 
# Homomorphic addition? What are the security implications of this?

"""
Homomorphic schemes are not CCA-secure.

Should the adversary have access to a decryption oracle, it would be able
to determine the value of b using addition of ciphertext combinations,
encryption of the results and comparison with the ciphertexts received from H2.

Additional security measures should be considered to prevent this,
for instance using zero-knowledge proofs.

###########################################################
# TASK Q2 -- Answer questions regarding your implementation
#
# Given your implementation of the private poll in TASK 5, how
# would a malicious user implement encode_vote to (a) distrupt the
# poll so that it yields no result, or (b) manipulate the poll so 
# that it yields an arbitrary result. Can those malicious actions 
# be detected given your implementation?

"""
The idea behind private polling is knowing the sum of all the votes,
without being able to tell what an individual voted for.

An adversary can use this to their advantage by implementing an encoding
function that uses arbitrarily large (positive OR negative) values to skew
the results based on their preferences.
